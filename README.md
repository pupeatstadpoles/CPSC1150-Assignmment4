Obtaining coordinates from user and calculating the perimeter of a triangle - Completed October 2022

Practises using methods to abstract the program. Program obtains x and y coordinates of 3 points on a plane from the user, then calculates whether the points form a triangle. If yes, the perimeter is calculated and returned to the user. Program also continues until user wishes to terminate the program by prompting user to input 1 for yes and 2 for no. 

Includes a method for validating input, verify_input(), which verifies if
- coordinates are positive integers
- coordinates are located on a 40 x 40 grid
- whether the coordinates form a straight line instead of a triangle
